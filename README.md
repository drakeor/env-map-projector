Catch2 for Unit Testing: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
Eigen for Linear Algebra operations: https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen

Note this repository has a copy of all the libraries (with the version I used) attached.

I know the default convention is to either submodule them or tell you to install them, but I've been burned by that when cloning other libraries and it's annoying to fix.
